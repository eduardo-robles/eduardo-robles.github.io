Accessing my homelab with Cloudflare
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
  Cloudflare Access for my Homelab</p>
<p>
I decided to use Cloudflare to setup a Secure Web Gateway and establish some Zero Trust access for my homelab services. Cloudflare offers a great service called ‚ÄúCloudflare Access‚Äù. Basically it leverages Cloudflare‚Äôs edge network to create secure web routing. Setting up this service is just a matter of running a simple daemon. Once configured you setup Cloudflare DNS to route traffic. Let‚Äôs discuss how I setup Cloudflare Access.
Create an SSH Bastion with Cloudflared
Setup a Raspberry Pi with Raspberry Pi OS or Ubuntu</p>
<p>
    Install Cloudflared
        Ubuntu/Debian install</p>
<div class="src src-sh">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">    wget -q https://bin.equinox.io/c/VdrWdbjqyF/cloudflared-stable-linux-amd64.deb
    dpkg -i cloudflared-stable-linux-amd64.deb</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Raspberry Pi</p>
<div class="src src-sh">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">    wget -q https://bin.equinox.io/c/VdrWdbjqyF/cloudflared-stable-linux-arm.tgz
    tar -xyzf cloudflared-stable-linux-arm.tgz
    sudo cp ./cloudflared /usr/local/bin
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cloudflared
    cloudflared -v</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Create a tunnel with Cloudflared</p>
<p>
    cloudflared tunnel login A browser window will open asking for authentication from Cloudflare.
    Setup a ‚ÄúSelf-hosted App‚Äù on Cloudflare Teams.</p>
<p>
    See this <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/self-hosted-apps">https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/self-hosted-apps</a>
    Configure tunnel on Raspberry Pi (or jump host)
        Find tunnel Id</p>
<div class="src src-sh">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">        cloudflared tunnel list</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
        Create/Edit Cloudflared Configurations
            location: <code class="verbatim">/home/pi/.cloudflared/config.yml</code>
        tunnel: TUNNEL_ID_GOES_HERE
        credentials-file: <code class="verbatim">/home/pi/.cloudflared/TUNNEL_ID.json</code></p>
<pre class="example">
        ingress:
          - hostname: rterm.eduardorobles.com
            service: ssh://localhost:22
          - service: http_status:404
</pre>
<p>Execute the tunnel</p>
<div class="src src-sh">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">        cloudflared tunnel run TUNNEL_NAME</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Route DNS for tunnel</p>
<p>
        cloudflared tunnel route dns TUNNEL_ID rterm.eduardorobles.com
    Access Raspberry Pi (or jump host)
        In browser go to <a href="https://rterm.eduardorobles.com">https://rterm.eduardorobles.com</a>
        Go through the login steps and you should be able to login to your jump host
    Connect from a client machine
        Install Cloudflared
        Configure SSH Config</p>
<div class="src src-sh">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">    Host rterm.eduardorobles.com
      ProxyCommand /usr/local/bin/cloudflared access ssh --hostname %h</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
    Adding another service
        Add settings to config.yml file
            Delete old config file /etc/cloudflared/config.yml
                Install service again</p>
<p>
Accessing All of my Services</p>
<p>
If you followed along you can see that in the last step we can add multiple ingress rules. For each service you want to router traffic to simply add it your configurations. In the example above I setup SSH access to my Raspberry Pi. Cloudflare can even render the SSH session in the browser for you.</p>
<p>
rendering an SSH session in the browser</p>
<p>
You can setup another machine with SSH to proxy your connection. But adding multiple ingress points allows you to access any and all of your services. Since you are using a Secure Web Gateway, your services are not automatically open on the internet.</p>
<p>
I also a Zero Trust Policy was setup which allows for very locked down sites. I setup 2 Factor Authentication for my Web Gateway. In the end I feel happy with the results and recommend anyone try Cloudflare Access.</p>

Starting a Homelab with Proxmox
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The Beginning</p>
<p>
So if you hadn‚Äôt heard of the idea of a ‚Äúhomelab‚Äù, let me give you the quick run down of what is a ‚Äúhomelab‚Äù. Basically, a homelab is a collection of technologies (hardware and software) that you install, maintain, and configure in your home. Imagine a datacenter in your home or an electronics lab can also be a homelab. At the heart of the homelab movement is the idea of tinkering and learning.</p>
<p>
Inspired by the idea of tinkering and learning I went down the path of building my own homelab. Luckily you don‚Äôt need a lot to started, older hardware can be a great start for beginners. That‚Äôs were my trusty old Dell Xeon workstation comes in. I was gifted this Dell Xeon workstation from a former client and I used it as a Ubuntu workstation for many years. It is a great machine and despite its age work like a champ. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs loud and does not meet the ‚ÄúWife Approval Factor‚Äù. To keep my wife and to start a new journey for this Dell, I decided to turn into my Proxmox machine!
The Homelab</p>
<p>
Now what is Proxmox?</p>
<p>
Proxmox is Type 1 Hypervisor that you can install on your own hardware. It allows you to run multiple Virtual Machines and Linux Containers (LXC). This is how I‚Äôm going be able to run various technologies in my home. Proxmox is a great hypervisor, it‚Äôs user friendly and built on a stable Debian base. I‚Äôm quite comfortable on Debian based distros, so going with Proxmox was a no-brainer.
The Services</p>
<p>
In order to stay a bit organized I made a list of services/technologies I wanted to run on my homelab. Below are the services I currently have installed.</p>
<div class="verse-block">
<p>File server
    Plex server
    Syncthing
    Git server
    Home Assistant
    GNS3 VM</p>
</div>
<p>I kept it minimal for now but I plan on added more services in the near future. I also plan on creating blog posts on each individual service I run. But for now that‚Äôs my start into homelabbing. Another important feature of homelabbing is the network setup. I will discuss that in a future post as I‚Äôm still working on building that out. So keep an eye out for more post in the near future.</p>

SSH Port Forward a VNC Connection
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Recently I wanted to access a Virtual Machine I had created on my desktop from my laptop. I had access to the desktop via SSH but I wanted access to the virtual machine. To make things more interesting I wanted to access the VM(virtual machine) via a graphical interface.</p>
<p>
So I figured out that I could use SSH to ‚Äúport forward‚Äù the VNC connection from the desktop to my laptop. It‚Äôs actually very easy and only requires a few basic SSH commands. All you have to know before hand is the IP addresses and ports of the application and what port you want to connect to locally.</p>
<p>
Definitions:</p>
<p>
pc-1: Is the computer you are connecting from, in this case the laptop.</p>
<p>
pc-2: Is the computer you are connecting to, in this case the desktop with the VM.</p>
<p>
So I use KVM to run the VM, so to get the VNC port from the running VM do the following.</p>
<div class="src src-bash">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo virsh dumpxml NameOfVM | grep vnc</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>You should see an output like this one.</p>
<pre class="example">
&lt;graphics type=&#39;vnc&#39; port=&#39;5901&#39; autoport=&#39;yes&#39; listen=&#39;127.0.0.1&#39;&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This tells you that KVM is running vnc on port 5901 on address 127.0.0.1 (localhost) for this virtual machine. Now it‚Äôs time to connect to the virtual machine from pc-1.</p>
<p>
In pc-1 run the following command to create an SSH tunnel that port forward the VNC connection.</p>
<div class="src src-bash">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">ssh user@pc-2 -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>What is is command doing?</p>
<pre class="example">
    ssh user@pc-2 is establishing the SSH connection to pc-2 with the user ‚Äúuser‚Äù. In your case, the user and IP address might be different e.g batman@10.10.0.1.
    -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901 is telling SSH agent to create a tunnel using local port 5901 and bind it to the remote machine address 127.0.0.1 on port 5901. The address on the remote machine might be different so that‚Äôs why we ran the virsh command to find it.
</pre>
<p>
Now that the SSH tunnel is established connect to the VM via VNC. You can use any remote viewer software like Remmina, TightVNC, or even Remote Viewer (part of Virtual Machine Viewer). Simply connect with the following parameters.</p>
<div class="src src-bash">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">vnc://localhost:5901</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>And the VNC connection should open up and start working. You can do everything you could locally via a remote VNC connection. Once you are done simply close the VNC connection and exit the SSH session.</p>
<p>
In this tutorial I showed how to this in KVM but VirtualBox and VMware have their own methods of doing this. Simply search for ‚Äúheadless‚Äù virtual machine for each to find out how to accomplish the same procedure.</p>
<p>
Congrats, you are now running a headless VM with a secure connection. SSH is cool tool that can do alot and if you combine it with other tools you can accomplish even more.</p>

My 2020 Ubuntu Laptop Setup
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-3">
<p>New Year, New Setup</p>
<p>
Ubuntu 19.10 Desktop</p>
<p>
I began the new year by buying a new 500GB SSD. My laptop had 2 drives: a 32GB SSD was my /root drive and a 120GB SSD was /home partition. This served me just well but obviously I would run out of space quickly if I was working with virtual machines. With a new drive I had to make the decision to start from scratch or use backups. I decided to start from scratch mainly because I wanted a clean and fast experience.
Operating System</p>
<p>
Though I have used Pop!OS in the past this time around I decided to install Ubuntu 19.10. I have Ubuntu 19.10 installed on my desktop and I really enjoyed it‚Äôs speed and perfomance. Plus it helps to know that both my laptop and desktop are running the same OS and version. Other distro‚Äôs I considered were: Fedora, and Manjaro.
Theme</p>
<p>
I recently came acros the Dracula theme for Emacs and I decided I needed this theme everywhere. Luckily you can go to <a href="https://draculatheme.com/">https://draculatheme.com/</a> and see all the theme options for a lot of apps.
Apps</p>
<p>
This is a list of my go to apps.</p>
<div class="verse-block">
<p>Emacs
    Spotify
    Evolution (Email client)
    Audacity
    Tizonia (Spotify terminal client)
    VLC
    Keybase</p>
</div>
<p>Other apps I install depending on the use case:</p>
<div class="verse-block">
<p>VPN
    Audacity
    Open Broadcaster
    GNOME Tweaks
    Syncthing
    Chromium</p>
</div>
<p>Configurations</p>
<p>
Ok, so let‚Äôs talk how I setup my laptop the quickest way possible.
Sign into my Google account in GNOME online accounts.</p>
<p>
This is to have Evolution setup as soon as it‚Äôs installed and launched.
Run my setup scripts</p>
<p>
I came across this great post by software dev Victoria Drake. She wrote a great bash script that she uses to setup her Ubuntu laptop (or even a VM). So I cloned it and modified it for my use. Here are some key take aways.</p>
<div class="src src-sh">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="color:#75715e"># Snap packages</span>

sudo snap install spotify

sudo snap install chromium

sudo snap install tizonia

<span style="color:#75715e"># GNOME</span>
install gnome-tweaks

<span style="color:#75715e"># File Backup</span>
install deja-dup
install git
install curl

<span style="color:#75715e"># add more apps as needed</span>

This is the script that is called to install my apps. This is only an example, in the real world I edited the script to add or remove apps that I wanted installed or removed. Another part of my setup scripts is the desktop.sh script.

<span style="color:#75715e"># Set GNOME Settings</span>
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences titlebar-font <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;IBM Plex Sans Bold 11&#39;</span>
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface monospace-font-name <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;IBM Plex Mono 13&#39;</span>
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface document-font-name <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;IBM Plex Sans Medium 11&#39;</span>
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface font-name <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;IBM Plex Sans 11&#39;</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Ubuntu 19.10 Terminal Dracula Theme</p>
<p>
I use this script to setup my fonts. It downloads IBM Plex font and installs it on my system. I love this font and thus I use it everywhere. My setup scripts do other things depending on what I want to do, like setup some PPA‚Äôs or change other GNOME settings.</p>
<p>
One thing that I found after I setup my laptop was this great script to change the terminal theme. It‚Äôs called Gogh and you can find it here <a href="https://github.com/Mayccoll/Gogh.">https://github.com/Mayccoll/Gogh.</a>
GPG, Git, and Emacs setup</p>
<p>
I do the basic GPG configurations, like download my GPG keys and setup my SSH keys. I also setup Git by adding SSH login, user name and email. Then I setup Emacs by downloading my configuration from my private repo. I set Emacs to run in daemon mode cause it‚Äôs faster than lighting this way :smile:. To run Emacs in daemon mode I simply run systemctl ‚Äìuser enable emacs.service and systemctl start emacs.service.</p>
<p>
Emacs 26.3
And that‚Äôs it</p>
<p>
The setup scripts do most of the grunt work. So I simply run them and a few minutes later all my apps and laptop is setup. After I do some post installation tweaks I‚Äôm ready to get to work in about 15 minutes. So I hope you all found this post insightful and useful. Some things that I didn‚Äôt discuss here but I did do were: I encrypted my drive on initial installation and I downloaded updates while I installed Ubuntu.</p>

Fixing Grub on a Dual Boot
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-13" class="outline-text-3">
<p>I recently decided to move my Ubuntu installation from my laptop to my desktop without having to reinstall. So basically all I wanted to do is move the SSD (which had Ubuntu 19.10 installed) in my laptop to my desktop. This process is not hard at all but in my case it was a little more complicated. I wanted to do a dual boot on my desktop computer with 2 different hard drives. One spinning disk hard drive will have a Windows 10 installation while the SSD from my laptop will have Ubuntu 19.10. Again I did not want to do any reinstall of Windows 10 or Ubuntu. So how can you accomplish this? Simple with the command update-grub.</p>
<p>
First I removed the SSD in the laptop and installed it in my desktop. I ensured that it was on the first SATA port so it can be the first hard drive the system recognizes. Once installed I booted up the computer and Ubuntu booted up correctly. Ok, so now I knew Ubuntu worked fine on the desktop.</p>
<p>
Next, I had to update grub inside of Ubuntu in order to add the Windows 10 disk to my boot order. Grub is actually pretty good at adding additional operating systems to the boot order. So turned off the computer ensured that my drives were in the correct SATA ports. After this step I ran into a small problem, Grub was not updating inside my Ubuntu installation. So I decided to boot into a Linux LiveUSB to help troubleshoot the errors.</p>
<p>
Inside the LiveUSB Linux environment I used a chroot environment to reach my Ubuntu  19.10 installation. To do so simply follow these steps.</p>
<div class="src src-sh">
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">sudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt

<span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> i in /dev/ /dev/pts /proc /sys /run; <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> sudo mount -B $i /mnt$i; <span style="color:#66d9ef">done</span>

sudo chroot /mnt</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Once in the chroot environment I ran update-grub and I still got an error. So I decided it would be best to simply reinstall grub. To do so simply run reinstall grub-pc (if you‚Äôre on a efi system please use grub-efi-amd64). This command worked and prompted me to chose where I wanted to install grub. I chose on the main disk since this is where I wanted to have grub installed. Once that process was done, I rebooted the system and was prompted with a working grub boot screen with both operating systems showing up correctly.</p>
<p>
Tip: If you want to customize your Grub boot screen you can do with the app Grub Customizer. Simply install it with sudo apt install grub-customizer. This allows you to add a background to Grub bootscreen, change the boot order, and much more.</p>

DuckDuckGo Mobile Browser
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-14" class="outline-text-3">
<p>I blogged before about switching from Firefox Focus to DuckDuckGo mobile. Now it‚Äôs been 3 weeks since I made the switch and I wanted to do a quick post about my experience.</p>
<p>
First, it‚Äôs going great. I really like the fact that a search widget is included. I replaced the Google search with DuckDuckGo and I find myself using it a lot more. Which is great because I really like using DuckDuckGo as my default search engine.</p>
<p>
Another great feature is the snappy-ness of the browser. DuckDuckGo mobile ‚Äúfeels‚Äù faster that Firefox Focus. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs because it was built with Chromium but it just feels faster. I was never really bothered by FF‚Äôs slowness but pages to render faster in DuckDuckGo.</p>
<p>
Also it‚Äôs been nice to have the option to have multiple tabs open. This was possible in FF but it was not as intuitive as it is DuckDuckGo. Though the ability to delete all tabs with one click is rock solid on both browsers.</p>
<p>
The one down side that I really experienced was the fact that not all apps were able to send URL links to DuckDuckGo mobile. For example, when I click on a link in a Youtube video description I do not get the option to open it in DuckDuckGo. I only get regular Firefox or Chrome. When I had Firefox Focus installed I could open that same link easily.</p>
<p>
Overall I am really happy with DuckDuckGo mobile and I would recommend it for anyone wanting a ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù browser. I still using Firefox Focus and may download it again in the future. But for now I‚Äôm sticking with DuckDuckGo mobile.</p>

Escape Rooms Challenge at STC
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-16" class="outline-text-3">
<p>To help celebrate National CyberSecurity Awareness month the Information Security office at South Texas College created an ‚ÄúEscape Room‚Äù challenge. I got to participate in this years festivities. I like the challenge of doing escape rooms so one that had a cybersecurity theme seemed even more fun. The activity was quite fun despite not being able to ‚Äúescape‚Äù in time.</p>
<p>
The challenge consisted of finding the decryption key to decrypt a computer that was attacked with Ransomware. The whole exercise was intended to show the damaging effects ransomware can have on a business or institution. After the challenge the moderators gave a brief talk on tips and tricks to securing your online identities and business.</p>

Firefox Focus
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-17" class="outline-text-3">
<p>I have been using Firefox Focus for about half a year now. I came to use because I was using Chrome and simply got paranoid of what stuff Google was collecting via Chrome. So I made the switch to Firefox on my PC and started using Firefox for Android. Now before I started using Firefox Focus I was using Brave Browser for Android.</p>
<p>
Brave Browser is a Chromium based browser that tauts privacy for the end user. Since I became paranoid of Google I naturally was paranoid of Google based technologies. Chromium though open source is a Google project. It‚Äôs development is steered by Google. So Google has a vested interest in Chromium. While making the switch to Firefox I came to learn about Firefox Focus via a Mozilla Newsletter. So I downloaded it and gave it a try.</p>
<p>
It was a bit weird getting used to it but after a while it was my default mobile browser. What made it great was the fact that my history was deleted after each use. I never had to worry about cookies or deleting search history. It kept my browsing experience as pure and fast as possible.</p>
<p>
This is why I was a bit disappointed at the latest update. The app started to have memory leak issues. Causing some battery drain on my phone. The issue wasn‚Äôt all that bad but it was annoying enough that I just unistalled the app.</p>
<p>
But I loved having a mobile browser that deleted search and use history after each use. When I looked in the Google Play store for other mobile browsers, DuckDuckGo, was recommnended. DuckDuckGo is my favorite search engine, so I was excited to see they offered a mobile browser. And it was highly rated (4.7 out 5) with a lot of positive reviews. I decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>
On first impressions I really like it and it feels faster than Firefox Focus. Plus if I want I can get DuckDuckGo browser via F-Droid store too. It‚Äôs only been a few days since I downloaded it but so far I‚Äôm really impressed with it. I‚Äôll continue to test it out and see if I stick to it or go back to Firefox Focus.</p>

My thoughts on ‚ÄúThe Alchemist‚Äù by Paulo Coelho
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-18" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho</p>
<p>
Since I have been reading ‚Äúself-help‚Äù books my wife suggested I check out The Alchemist. Luckily she owned a copy, so I grabbed it from our bookshelf and stuffed it in my backpack. I gotta say that I really enjoyed this book. I can now see why so many people consider it a ‚Äúself-help‚Äù, book. Here are a two of my favorite passages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer‚Äù, the boy told the alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky.</p>
<p>
‚ÄúTell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse that the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second‚Äôs encounter with God and with eternity‚Äù.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I loved this part because it closely aligns with my own personal beliefs on suffering. You cannot hope to succeed without a bit of hard work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúEvery second of the search is an encounter with God‚Äù, the boy told his heart. ‚ÄúWhen I have been truly searching for my treasure, every day has been luminous, because I‚Äôve know that every hour was a part of the dream that I find it. When I have been truly searching for my treasure, I‚Äôve discovered things along the way that I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that seemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve‚Äù.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I got teary eyed when reading this part. It‚Äôs funny how sometimes you read something and it spurs such a deep emotion. That‚Äôs how I felt reading this part in the book. I‚Äôve always characterized myself as an optimist and I believe that it takes a bit of courage to remain an optimist in this day and age.</p>

My thoughts on ‚ÄúSmarter Faster Better: The Transformative Power of Real Productivity‚Äù by Charles Duhigg
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-19" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Smarter Faster Better: The Transformative Power of Real Productivity by Charles Duhigg</p>
<p>
I had heard so much of Charles Duhigg from many ‚Äúentrepreneurial youtubers‚Äù, so naturally I became curious of his work. Most people recommend his book The Power of Habit, I even remember a colleague reading it. But I didn‚Äôt find a copy of it at my local library but I did find a copy of Smarter Faster Better instead. Oh boy was I happy with this book. I highly recommend this book for anyone, especially if you are looking for ways to be more ‚Äúproductive‚Äù. The book is full of stories of how people, organizations, or businesses overcame serious obstacles to come out on top. Here‚Äôs my favorite part from the book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This, ultimately, is one of the most important lessons of places such as NUMMI and the lean and agile philosophies: Employees work smarter and better when they believed they have more decision-making authority and when they believe their colleagues are committed to their success. A sense of control can fuel motivations, people need to know their suggestions won‚Äôt be ignored, that their mistakes won‚Äôt be held against them. And they need to know that everyone else has their back.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There has been very few work environments where I felt trust between myself and management. This always left me alienated and demotivated. But I‚Äôve had other jobs where I truly felt like I was part of the team. Those were great jobs and enjoyed my time at them. Not just because it was a fun working environment but because at the end of the day I felt that my work meant something.</p>

Why I got a Library Card in 2019
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-20" class="outline-text-3">
<p>I was having a conversation with my wife and I said to her ‚ÄúYou know, I feel like I‚Äôm getting dumber‚Äù. We both laughed out loud at my ridiculous statement, she then asked why I felt that. The reason I was l feeling like that was because I was simply spending too much time on other silly distractions. And no it wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù, I tend to go down YouTube rabbit holes too. So I decided to try a small experiment. Reading.</p>
<p>
In high school I read quite a bit, I was a lector at my church which required me to read the Bible. Though I never read the Bible for fun, just for my role as lector. Then in college my degree required a lot of reading. Every semester I must have read at least 10 books plus academic journal articles. So I did plenty of reading during that time in my life and I guess I got burned out on reading. I know this happens to many people but many get back to reading soon after. For me it was years since I had read a book from cover to cover.</p>
<p>
So in the end I decided I wanted to read more. But starting something is always the hardest part of any project. I wanted to read more but I didn‚Äôt want to spend money on books that I wasn‚Äôt sure I‚Äôd like reading. My solution, the local library! I went down one Sunday afternoon and asked for a library card. I got a card in 15 minutes I got card and checked out my first book.</p>
<p>
Lucky for me my local library has a great selection of books. Plus they are part of a regional system which allows me to find more book across libraries in the county. In the end I checked out a book title Why Buddhism is True by Robert Wright. I read it in the 2 weeks checkout period and I really enjoyed the book.</p>
<p>
in the end I‚Äôve been reading more and taking full advantage of free books at my local library. So if you want to get into reading go get a library card and checkout a few books.</p>

Reset Windows Password with Linux
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-21" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Ever needed to reset your Windows password but forgot to make a Windows Reset Password disk? If so, you can easily reset a Windows Users password with a Live Linux USB. Let‚Äôs see just how easy it is to so.</p>
<p>
    If you don‚Äôt a Live Linux USB go ahead an create one. This tutorial is Ubuntu based so any Ubuntu flavor will work. And you will need a working internet connection to download software.
    Start the computer and boot into the Live Linux environment.
    Once in the Live Linux environment make sure you connect to the internet and open a terminal.
    You will need to install tool called chntpw. So ahead and run the following command to install chntpw apt-get install chntpw
    Once installed you will have to mount the hard drive that has Windows installed. There are many ways of doing this but you can use the File Manager (Nautilus in Ubuntu) to make things easy.
    Once you have the Windows Harddrive mounted go to the following directory <em>windowsHarddrive/Windows/System32/config</em>
    Now that you are at the correct directory, right click and chose Open With
    Terminal Here.
    In the terminal simply type the following command to interact with chntpwsudo chntpw SAM
    Now you are editing the Administrator user if you would like to edit another user use this command.sudo chntpw -u USERYOUWANTTOEDIT SAM
    After you‚Äôve chosen your user it‚Äôs time to reset their password. Simply type 1 in ther User Edit Menu. And then chose y when prompted to Write hive
    files
    Then to quit type q and this will exit chntpw
    Close the terminal and restart your computer making sure to remove the Live Linux USB.
    You should boot into Windows desktop directly without any login. Be sure to add a new password!</p>
<p>
Congratulations you have successfully reset your Windows with Linux! And that‚Äôs it!</p>

Relaunching my personal website

<p>Leaving social media</p>
<p>
So this week I found myself falling down a crazy rabbit hole. It all happened when I watched this video on the indieweb concept. I was hooked on the idea and philosophy of the indeweb! Just recently I had been putting a lot of thought on leaving social media behind. But of course in this day and age doing that is much easier said than done. Still I had this gut feeling telling me that I just didn‚Äôt want to be on platforms like facebook any more.
Indieweb FTW</p>
<p>
One of the core concepts of the indieweb is to ‚Äúown‚Äù, your content. This is the by far the thing that drew me into the movement. Over the past 2 month I had relaunched my business website and stepped up my video creation. I was happy that I was writing more original content and creating at my own pace. But after watching that video I knew I had to do more with ALL of my content. Oh boy we sometime forget just how much content we create on a daily basis. Indieweb movement tries to get you to understand your content and most importantly allows you to put out onto the world the way you want it.
So here we are</p>
<p>
This site was relaunched with wordpress and with indieweb principles in mind. I‚Äôm happy I took the plunge even though it drove me a bit crazy at times. I think I‚Äôll do more of a deep dive on all the moving parts in a later post. But it feels good to be taking control of my content, soon I‚Äôll be saying goodbye to social media!</p>
