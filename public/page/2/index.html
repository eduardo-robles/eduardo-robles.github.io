		Smarter Faster Better: The Transformative Power of Real Productivity by Charles Duhigg
I had heard so much of Charles Duhigg from many ‚Äúentrepreneurial youtubers‚Äù, so naturally I became curious of his work. Most people recommend his book The Power of Habit, I even remember a colleague reading it. But I didn‚Äôt find a copy of it at my local library but I did find a copy of Smarter Faster Better instead.

		To help celebrate National CyberSecurity Awareness month the Information Security office at South Texas College created an ‚ÄúEscape Room‚Äù challenge. I got to participate in this years festivities. I like the challenge of doing escape rooms so one that had a cybersecurity theme seemed even more fun. The activity was quite fun despite not being able to ‚Äúescape‚Äù in time.
The challenge consisted of finding the decryption key to decrypt a computer that was attacked with Ransomware.

		I was having a conversation with my wife and I said to her ‚ÄúYou know, I feel like I‚Äôm getting dumber‚Äù. We both laughed out loud at my ridiculous statement, she then asked why I felt that. The reason I was l feeling like that was because I was simply spending too much time on other silly distractions. And no it wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù, I tend to go down YouTube rabbit holes too.

		Leaving social media
So this week I found myself falling down a crazy rabbit hole. It all happened when I watched this video on the indieweb concept. I was hooked on the idea and philosophy of the indeweb! Just recently I had been putting a lot of thought on leaving social media behind. But of course in this day and age doing that is much easier said than done. Still I had this gut feeling telling me that I just didn‚Äôt want to be on platforms like facebook any more.
