				<p>Leaving social media</p>
<p>So this week I found myself falling down a crazy rabbit hole. It all happened when I watched this video on the indieweb concept. I was hooked on the idea and philosophy of the indeweb! Just recently I had been putting a lot of thought on leaving social media behind. But of course in this day and age doing that is much easier said than done. Still I had this gut feeling telling me that I just didn‚Äôt want to be on platforms like facebook any more.
Indieweb FTW</p>
<p>One of the core concepts of the indieweb is to ‚Äúown‚Äù, your content. This is the by far the thing that drew me into the movement. Over the past 2 month I had relaunched my business website and stepped up my video creation. I was happy that I was writing more original content and creating at my own pace. But after watching that video I knew I had to do more with ALL of my content. Oh boy we sometime forget just how much content we create on a daily basis. Indieweb movement tries to get you to understand your content and most importantly allows you to put out onto the world the way you want it.
So here we are</p>
<p>This site was relaunched with wordpress and with indieweb principles in mind. I‚Äôm happy I took the plunge even though it drove me a bit crazy at times. I think I‚Äôll do more of a deep dive on all the moving parts in a later post. But it feels good to be taking control of my content, soon I‚Äôll be saying goodbye to social media!</p>
