				<p>Smarter Faster Better: The Transformative Power of Real Productivity by Charles Duhigg</p>
<p>I had heard so much of Charles Duhigg from many ‚Äúentrepreneurial youtubers‚Äù, so naturally I became curious of his work. Most people recommend his book The Power of Habit, I even remember a colleague reading it. But I didn‚Äôt find a copy of it at my local library but I did find a copy of Smarter Faster Better instead. Oh boy was I happy with this book. I highly recommend this book for anyone, especially if you are looking for ways to be more ‚Äúproductive‚Äù. The book is full of stories of how people, organizations, or businesses overcame serious obstacles to come out on top. Here‚Äôs my favorite part from the book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This, ultimately, is one of the most important lessons of places such as NUMMI and the lean and agile philosophies: Employees work smarter and better when they believed they have more decision-making authority and when they believe their colleagues are committed to their success. A sense of control can fuel motivations, people need to know their suggestions won‚Äôt be ignored, that their mistakes won‚Äôt be held against them. And they need to know that everyone else has their back.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There has been very few work environments where I felt trust between myself and management. This always left me alienated and demotivated. But I‚Äôve had other jobs where I truly felt like I was part of the team. Those were great jobs and enjoyed my time at them. Not just because it was a fun working environment but because at the end of the day I felt that my work meant something.</p>
