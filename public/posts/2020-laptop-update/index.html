				<p>New Year, New Setup</p>
<p>Ubuntu 19.10 Desktop</p>
<p>I began the new year by buying a new 500GB SSD. My laptop had 2 drives: a 32GB SSD was my /root drive and a 120GB SSD was /home partition. This served me just well but obviously I would run out of space quickly if I was working with virtual machines. With a new drive I had to make the decision to start from scratch or use backups. I decided to start from scratch mainly because I wanted a clean and fast experience.
Operating System</p>
<p>Though I have used Pop!OS in the past this time around I decided to install Ubuntu 19.10. I have Ubuntu 19.10 installed on my desktop and I really enjoyed itâ€™s speed and perfomance. Plus it helps to know that both my laptop and desktop are running the same OS and version. Other distroâ€™s I considered were: Fedora, and Manjaro.
Theme</p>
<p>I recently came acros the Dracula theme for Emacs and I decided I needed this theme everywhere. Luckily you can go to <a href="https://draculatheme.com/">https://draculatheme.com/</a> and see all the theme options for a lot of apps.
Apps</p>
<p>This is a list of my go to apps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emacs
Spotify
Evolution (Email client)
Audacity
Tizonia (Spotify terminal client)
VLC
Keybase</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other apps I install depending on the use case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>VPN
Audacity
Open Broadcaster
GNOME Tweaks
Syncthing
Chromium</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Configurations</p>
<p>Ok, so letâ€™s talk how I setup my laptop the quickest way possible.
Sign into my Google account in GNOME online accounts.</p>
<p>This is to have Evolution setup as soon as itâ€™s installed and launched.
Run my setup scripts</p>
<p>I came across this great post by software dev Victoria Drake. She wrote a great bash script that she uses to setup her Ubuntu laptop (or even a VM). So I cloned it and modified it for my use. Here are some key take aways.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="color:#75715e"># Snap packages</span>

sudo snap install spotify

sudo snap install chromium

sudo snap install tizonia

<span style="color:#75715e"># GNOME</span>
install gnome-tweaks

<span style="color:#75715e"># File Backup</span>
install deja-dup
install git
install curl

<span style="color:#75715e"># add more apps as needed</span>

This is the script that is called to install my apps. This is only an example, in the real world I edited the script to add or remove apps that I wanted installed or removed. Another part of my setup scripts is the desktop.sh script.

<span style="color:#75715e"># Set GNOME Settings</span>
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences titlebar-font <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;IBM Plex Sans Bold 11&#39;</span>
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface monospace-font-name <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;IBM Plex Mono 13&#39;</span>
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface document-font-name <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;IBM Plex Sans Medium 11&#39;</span>
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface font-name <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;IBM Plex Sans 11&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Ubuntu 19.10 Terminal Dracula Theme</p>
<p>I use this script to setup my fonts. It downloads IBM Plex font and installs it on my system. I love this font and thus I use it everywhere. My setup scripts do other things depending on what I want to do, like setup some PPAâ€™s or change other GNOME settings.</p>
<p>One thing that I found after I setup my laptop was this great script to change the terminal theme. Itâ€™s called Gogh and you can find it here <a href="https://github.com/Mayccoll/Gogh">https://github.com/Mayccoll/Gogh</a>.
GPG, Git, and Emacs setup</p>
<p>I do the basic GPG configurations, like download my GPG keys and setup my SSH keys. I also setup Git by adding SSH login, user name and email. Then I setup Emacs by downloading my configuration from my private repo. I set Emacs to run in daemon mode cause itâ€™s faster than lighting this way :smile:. To run Emacs in daemon mode I simply run systemctl &ndash;user enable emacs.service and systemctl start emacs.service.</p>
<p>Emacs 26.3
And thatâ€™s it</p>
<p>The setup scripts do most of the grunt work. So I simply run them and a few minutes later all my apps and laptop is setup. After I do some post installation tweaks Iâ€™m ready to get to work in about 15 minutes. So I hope you all found this post insightful and useful. Some things that I didnâ€™t discuss here but I did do were: I encrypted my drive on initial installation and I downloaded updates while I installed Ubuntu.</p>
