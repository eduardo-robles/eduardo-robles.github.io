				<p>I was having a conversation with my wife and I said to her ‚ÄúYou know, I feel like I‚Äôm getting dumber‚Äù. We both laughed out loud at my ridiculous statement, she then asked why I felt that. The reason I was l feeling like that was because I was simply spending too much time on other silly distractions. And no it wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù, I tend to go down YouTube rabbit holes too. So I decided to try a small experiment. Reading.</p>
<p>In high school I read quite a bit, I was a lector at my church which required me to read the Bible. Though I never read the Bible for fun, just for my role as lector. Then in college my degree required a lot of reading. Every semester I must have read at least 10 books plus academic journal articles. So I did plenty of reading during that time in my life and I guess I got burned out on reading. I know this happens to many people but many get back to reading soon after. For me it was years since I had read a book from cover to cover.</p>
<p>So in the end I decided I wanted to read more. But starting something is always the hardest part of any project. I wanted to read more but I didn‚Äôt want to spend money on books that I wasn‚Äôt sure I‚Äôd like reading. My solution, the local library! I went down one Sunday afternoon and asked for a library card. I got a card in 15 minutes I got card and checked out my first book.</p>
<p>Lucky for me my local library has a great selection of books. Plus they are part of a regional system which allows me to find more book across libraries in the county. In the end I checked out a book title Why Buddhism is True by Robert Wright. I read it in the 2 weeks checkout period and I really enjoyed the book.</p>
<p>in the end I‚Äôve been reading more and taking full advantage of free books at my local library. So if you want to get into reading go get a library card and checkout a few books.</p>
