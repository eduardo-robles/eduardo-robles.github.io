			<h1>DuckDuckGo Mobile Browser</h1>

				<p>I blogged before about switching from Firefox Focus to DuckDuckGo mobile. Now it‚Äôs been 3 weeks since I made the switch and I wanted to do a quick post about my experience.</p>
<p>First, it‚Äôs going great. I really like the fact that a search widget is included. I replaced the Google search with DuckDuckGo and I find myself using it a lot more. Which is great because I really like using DuckDuckGo as my default search engine.</p>
<p>Another great feature is the snappy-ness of the browser. DuckDuckGo mobile ‚Äúfeels‚Äù faster that Firefox Focus. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs because it was built with Chromium but it just feels faster. I was never really bothered by FF‚Äôs slowness but pages to render faster in DuckDuckGo.</p>
<p>Also it‚Äôs been nice to have the option to have multiple tabs open. This was possible in FF but it was not as intuitive as it is DuckDuckGo. Though the ability to delete all tabs with one click is rock solid on both browsers.</p>
<p>The one down side that I really experienced was the fact that not all apps were able to send URL links to DuckDuckGo mobile. For example, when I click on a link in a Youtube video description I do not get the option to open it in DuckDuckGo. I only get regular Firefox or Chrome. When I had Firefox Focus installed I could open that same link easily.</p>
<p>Overall I am really happy with DuckDuckGo mobile and I would recommend it for anyone wanting a ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù browser. I still using Firefox Focus and may download it again in the future. But for now I‚Äôm sticking with DuckDuckGo mobile.</p>
