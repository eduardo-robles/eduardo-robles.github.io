## 2024 TAGITM South Texas Regional Summit {#2024-tagitm-south-texas-regional-summit}

**The Digital Force Awakens: Mastering Threat Hunting in the Cyber Galaxy**

I had the pleasure of attending the [TAGITM](https://tagitm.org) Regional Summit on Threat Hunting and Digital Forensics. The Summit focused on enhancing the skills of Texas cybersecurity workforce. The last few years have been rough for many Texas companies and governmental agencies. The rise in ransomware and cyberattacks has increased the need for these type of events.

Luckily there are great organizations such as TAGITM, TEEX, and CISA who can bring the knowledge and experience to eager learners. The event was sponsored by many great vendors who are doing great work in the cybersecurity landscape.

The first part of the day was a Threat Hunting workshop by TEEX. The later part of the day consisted of a hands-on exercise in Digital Forensics. The entire day was filled with great insight and meaningful practice. In the Digital Forensics workshop we got first hand experience with using `FTK Imager`. This is a great tool for running a digital forensic analysis. I was exicted to learn `FTK Imager` since my previous experience was with `Autopsy`.

I had a great time at the event and I learned so much. I am so glad TAGITM was able to put on this event with great speakers and sponsors.
