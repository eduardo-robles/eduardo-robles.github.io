Hi there!

Follow along with me in this video as I install Fog Server. To learn more about Fog Project check out there website <https://fogproject.org/>. The installation is done with a simple script that you download from the project website.

For this example I used Cent OS which you can get at the website here <https://centos.org>. You can use a Debian based OS as well but I chose Cent OS.

Somethings to keep in mind:

1.  Never run as root. Create a user and elevate privileges.
2.  Be sure to have a password ready, during the installation you will be prompted to create a MySQL account for the database.
3.  The Fog Project login page is located at <http://localhost.lan/fog/management>
4.  The installation can take a while so be patient.
