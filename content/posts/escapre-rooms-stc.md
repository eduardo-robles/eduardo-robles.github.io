To help celebrate National CyberSecurity Awareness month the Information Security office at South Texas College created an “Escape Room” challenge. I got to participate in this years festivities. I like the challenge of doing escape rooms so one that had a cybersecurity theme seemed even more fun. The activity was quite fun despite not being able to “escape” in time.

The challenge consisted of finding the decryption key to decrypt a computer that was attacked with Ransomware. The whole exercise was intended to show the damaging effects ransomware can have on a business or institution. After the challenge the moderators gave a brief talk on tips and tricks to securing your online identities and business.
