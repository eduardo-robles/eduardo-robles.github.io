**Atreus Keyboard**

_Ergonomics_

This [keyboard](https://shop.keyboard.io/products/keyboardio-atreus) is small and light. I found it to be an amazing size and shape. I don't think it is too small or too close together I actually found it very comfortable. I did experience some fatigue in the beginning but that was from poor typing technique. I am a bit of a finger and touch typist. I tend to finger type with my left hand which made hitting keys like the **C** key really annoying because I'm used to lifting my left hand and pressing the C key with my left index finger. Super weird way to type, I know but that is what I grew accustomed to and never really fixed. Well the Atreus forces you to fix that. My left hand had a lot of bad habits to break, luckily I am patient.

_Customizing_

Atreus is a fully Open Source keyboard which is awesome. I used the [Chrysalis](https://github.com/keyboardio/Chrysalis) software to configure the keyboard to my liking. I felt the default keybindings were confusing and too opinionated. I did some research online and found blogs about other users configurations. I found this great post on <https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/Atreus> and I followed most of his keybindings. I still managed to create my own keybindings which is the point of a fully customizable keyboard.

_Conclusion_

In closing this is awesome keyboard. It has so much potential and I am excited to keep using it. I will post updates on my progress with this keyboard.
